AdminUtils - For Bukkit

### Project
AdminUtils is a Administration Utilities Plugin for bukkit. It is aimed to make your life as an administrator easier with
a highly configurable plugin. We're working on trying to implement the plugin with as many different external plugins as we can,
as well as adding our own customizable commands and features.

### Dependencies
* Bukkit/Spigot 1.7.9
* Vault

### Contribute!
We're looking for people who want to help contribute to the plugin! If you want to add a feature, or help out, fork the repo, and submit a Pull request! (If you contribute a lot, we'll add you as a contributor on bukkit :P)
